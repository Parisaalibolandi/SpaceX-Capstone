# SpaceX-Capstone
SpaceX promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a price of 62 million dollars, which is significantly lower than the upward of 165 million dollars charged by other providers. A major factor contributing to these cost savings is SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. Consequently, by assessing the likelihood of the first stage successfully landing, we can estimate the overall cost of a launch. This knowledge becomes valuable if another company wishes to compete with SpaceX in bidding for a rocket launch project. In this endeavor, I have provided a detailed, step-by-step explanation, concluding with predictions generated through various models and a comparative chart.
